Simple Image Encryption Tool
This is a fun little Python project that lets you encrypt an image using basic techniques. It's part of the SkillCraft Internship (Cyber Security domain).
🔐 What It Does
You give it an image, and it will change the pixels to make the image unreadable. You can choose how it does that:
Swap pixels side by side
Add a secret key to each color in the image
Do both together for extra scrambling
The new, encrypted image will be saved automatically.
▶️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.
🛠️ What You'll Be Asked
The file path of the image you want to encrypt (e.g., myphoto.png)
The encryption method (choose 1, 2, or 3)
If needed, a number between 0–255 as your "secret key"

💾 What You Get
After running, you'll get a new image file like:
myphoto_encrypted.png
This will look scrambled depending on the method you chose.
